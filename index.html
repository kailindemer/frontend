                <h3><strong>Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich:</strong></h3>
                <p>The classic bacon egg and cheese is pretty self explanatory, consisting of one to two either scrambled or fried eggs, a few strips of bacon, and a couple slices of cheese. It's commonly made with American, but Cheddar is a popular substitute. Since you'll be making it, you can use whatever cheese you want for this breakfast delight.</p>

                <h3><strong>Sausage Egg and Cheese Sandwich:</strong></h3>
                <p>The sausage egg and cheese sadnwich is a popular take on the classic bacon egg and cheese. Instead of bacon, we add sausage to our sandwich. Depending on the sausage used, this sandwich can be a bit more salty and/or greasy than the classic, good old bacon egg and cheese.</p>

        <h3><Strong>Instructions:</Strong></h3>
        <ol id="list">
            <li>First, heat up a griddle or two large pans, this recipe has a lot of frying and toasting.</li>
            <li>Cut your bagel in half and lightly butter the inside in order to get that optimal golden-brown toasting.</li>
            <li>Place your bagel butter-side-down on your griddle and let it toast while you're making everything else, or for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>For the bacon, put them on the griddle or pan and cook them on low heat, turning them often to get a nice browning. Once they are crispy enough for you, take them off the heat and pat the grease off with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Next, you can make either a fried egg or a scrambled egg for your sandwich.
                <ul id="nested">
                    <li>For a fried egg: Crack your eggs directly onto a buttered griddle and leave it until it starts to turn opaque. Once the egg white has become fully opaque but the yolk is still runny, break the yolk by lightly chopping at it repeatedly. Then wait until the yolk has stopped running and is solid and your egg is done.</li>
                    <li>For a scrambled egg: Crack your eggs into a bowl and add your 2T of milk if desired. (it'll make them a bit fluffier and extra delectable) Whisk until your eggs are a uniform color and consistency and pour into a pre-heated pan with either butter or oil. Stir your eggs in the pan to keep them from sticking until they are the desired concistency.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In order to add your cheesy goodness to this masterpiece of a sandwich, you can either put the cheese on your fried eggs once you've broken the yolk to get that extra meltage or simply place in a pyramid on your sandwich after putting everything else on.</li>
            <li>Lastly, assemble this exuisite sandwich. My favorite way is to have the eggs on the bottom, then the cheese, then the bacon.</li>
